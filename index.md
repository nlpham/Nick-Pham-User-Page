## Who Am I?
![This is ME!](https://pkimgcdn.peekyou.com/5a5a68d7501b179019311ba55abf86a6.jpeg)
I am a **UCSD** undergraduate in my 4th year and I major in **Math-Computer Science**.
As a side gig I bake cheesecake, but on my free time I enjoy *gaming* and have started to do a little *gardening*.
In the words of Future:
>I love cheesecake, I love cheesecake at night time, real late at night, the cheesecake could do it man. Top it off before you go to sleep. Just the regular one, original. it tastes like, cheesecake. Sensational.
I am not quite sure what code to quote so I guess i'll just `git commit`ed and choose a command.
That was supposed to be a naaaasty pun [Boo YAH!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kSrbmMW1AY)
